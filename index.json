We propose a deep-learning approach to separating Twitter data out into contextualized networks. We then show that these contextualized networks have very different nodesets, topology, and central actors than observed in the non-contextualized networks. Our findings suggest that the dominant way of modeling social media conversations may be inaccurately portraying the nature of the conversations and the most important people in them.","tags":["Contextualized Networks","Network Dynamics","Community Detection","Topic Modeling"],"title":"Contextualizing Online Conversational Networks","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Magelinski"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1651104000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1651104000,"objectID":"7202059231ff88507f9dc2b5018799b0","permalink":"/publication/thesis_proposal/","publishdate":"2022-04-20T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/thesis_proposal/","section":"publication","summary":"Network Science provides a framework to understand the large-scale discussions that happen on social media and their impact on society. However, a standard network model of a conversational network destroys the context that users are interacting within. First, the interactional context is destroyed. The interactional component of context includes the content of the conversation in which the users are interacting. When interactional context is not accounted for, separate discussions are combined into one big network, artificially inflating the number of nodes and edges in the network. This leads to inaccurate information about conversation structure and important actors. Next, the personal context is destroyed. The personal component of context includes the attributes of the users involved, as observed through their self-descriptions. Long-standing social theory of offline social communities such as self-categorization place great importance on personal context. Thus, this context needs to be accounted for to test these theories in the social media setting.   This thesis provides the theory and methodologies needed to account for both interactional and personal contexts which were previously lost in network analysis of social media conversations. Specifically, I study the importance of these contexts as they relate to community dynamics. I find that network structure is indeed dependent on interactional context, indicating that existing non-contextualized analyses could be improved. When investigating personal context, I find that the long-standing theory of self-categorization can be extended from offline social communities to massive online communities, with some important limitations. Taken together, the dynamic contextualized analysis outlined in this thesis furthers our understanding of attribute salience in online interactions. Each of these analyses is performed on multiple case studies, providing both validation and a set of examples used to detail a list of best practices for contextualized network analysis.","tags":["Network Dynamics","Social Media","Contextualized Networks"],"title":"Contextualized Conversational Network Dynamics on Social Media","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Magelinski","Lynnette Ng","Kathleen M.

These data streams include legislative bill text, posts on Ukrainian political blogs, and Twitter data. Each stream provides a different perspective: politicians, local citizens, and global citizens. It is apparent that bill production stalled early on in the demonstrations, and that the post-revolution government quickly began voting on bills. Topic analysis of blogs and tweets revealed growing interest in Ukraine following the march on the legislature. Interest in Ukraine eventually overtook that of the conflict in the Middle East, before dying back down in the following month. Our results suggest that a stall in bill production may be an early indicator of dysfunction in the government, while spikes in Twitter activity can be seen almost immediately after the event. This effect is true for blogs as well, although for a prolonged period, implying a more detailed discourse about the event.","tags":["Community Detection","Network Dynamics","Voting Networks","Topic Modeling"],"title":"Artifacts of Crisis: Textual Analysis of Euromaidan","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Magelinski","Mihovil Bartulovic","Kathleen M.

After the histograms are created, traditional convolutional layers can be used to classify the graph. This procedure leverages all available information, regardless of how the size of graphs vary.

We compare two methods: ideal point estimation (PolSci) and faction detection (CS). Both methods identify the revolution in Ukraine in 2014. The faction detection method also detects structural changes prior to the revolution (election of the president whose tenure was ended early by the revolution), while the ideal points method performs stronger after 2014, identifying a disruption around voting on constitutional changes to implement Minsk II agreements between separatists and Ukraine. The ideal point method is better at detecting position changes of the members of parliament, while the faction method is better at detecting changes in relationships between different MPs. The results suggest that after 2014, the Ukrainian parliament has become more consolidated, but the distribution of its political positions continues to evolve in response to changes in geo-political conditions.","tags":["Community Detection","Network Dynamics","Voting Networks"],"title":"Detecting Disruption: Identifying Structural Changes in the Verkhovna Rada","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Tom Magelinski","Kathleen M.

Some political systems, such as Ukraine’s Verkovna Rada, are inherently dynamic, and should be modeled as such. In the model proposed, the entire legislative body is modeled together and bills are viewed as a dynamic process. This model requires no contextual information about individual legislators and predicts the amount of favorable votes a bill will receive within 6.2%, on average. Additionally, we find differences in behavior of bills proposed by the President and those proposed by parliament members or the Cabinet.
